    <p>Art that i would like to showcase will present you the artists prolonged process of painting with ADHD — it depicts a strong message to the viewer explaining A journey that Art
      takes, Art is never complete, there is never a point where the artist is satisfied with what’s on the canvas, the dull motive gives the viewer an opputunity to capture there own
      interpretation of what is seen on canvas, each direction the Art is being taken changes throughout the days the artist works on the piece - changing and forming something beyond
      interpretation - subliminal key references are implemented for the artists own pleasure. the rest are puzzled images that are only recognised when the viewer dissects the canvas rather than
      viewing it as one whole.</p> <!-- paragraph for biography -->

    <p>The Art that is viewed gives one interpretation but in a split moment can give you something else - before you realise, you’ve been staring at it for at least an hour only to be
      questioning your own interpretation.</p> <!-- paragraph for biography -->
