I've learned certain key things from using html, css, and javascript - which is simplicity, interpretable ui, and structure. I've benefited and noted these ideas and implemented 
it within my code. I've learnt a lot through reading documentations on functions, tags, etc. which kept me intrigued to learn more. I'll definitely take in more knowledge for the
coming tasks.
