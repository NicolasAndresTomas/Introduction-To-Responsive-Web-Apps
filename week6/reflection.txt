For this week’s tasks we’ve continued from our previous weeks 4 & 5, as we now developed in-depth skills on Vue’s framework. In this week’s task we’ve experimented with handling user inputs, such as creating a form input binding. We’ve also had a look at more components and the concepts on how bindings and modifiers work. Understanding this weeks concepts has made me adapt deeper knowledge on Vue’s functions and components.
