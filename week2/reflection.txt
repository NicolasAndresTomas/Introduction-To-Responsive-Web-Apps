For this week’s tasks we’ve covered in improving our responsive web page as we implemented both CSS and JavaScript. I have contributed to apply minimal changes for my proposed project, these include advanced concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To conclude it all, I’ve had practice with incorporating user stories and UI/UX design, as this will be included to partake the proposed requirements for my upcoming project.
