I've understood the concept in writing small notes within the code that makes it easier to intepret, i've also given 3 examples of user stories - the code i've uploaded has made some minor changes in html and css, ive also included a media video. A UX/UI tool is also something I've fiddled around with through using figma, ive understood how you could implement and design using an interface device on a virtual screen.
