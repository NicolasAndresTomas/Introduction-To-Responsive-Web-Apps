    <h2>Task 1 – Understand about responsive web Pages and apps </h2>

    <h4><a class="site" href="https://www.clairegingell.com/">SITE 1</a></h4>

    <p>The site shown within the link "SITE 1" - shares an identical responsive web design when compared between the mobile and desktop. This site contains a set viewport meta which scales the size of the website through different devices, shown below is an image that is taken on an iPhone XR. As you can see the website is positioned to fit within the screen of the device along with other sections such as the images, paragraphs, and menu.</p>

    <img src="images/website1.jpg" alt="site1">

    <img src="images/mobilesite1.jpg" alt="site1">

    <h4><a class="site" href="https://www.artsyasha.com/">SITE 2</a></h4>

    <p>The site shown within the link "SITE 2" - is somewhat differential when compared to both mobile and desktop devices. As this responsive web design is
    also set as a viewport meta, sections within the mobile device seem to position in a clustored form due to scaling and sizing although all sections
    manahge to fit within the spaces of both devices.</p>

    <h2>Task 2 – CSS and Improve your web page</h2>

    <p>The site shown within the link "SITE 2" - is somewhat differential when compared to both mobile and desktop devices. As this responsive web design is also set as a viewport meta, sections within the mobile device seem to position in a clustered form due to scaling and sizing although all sections manage to fit within the spaces of both devices.</p>
